# Project Scope

Short description of what this project is about.

- Work with daily stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- Focus on a small set of tech/software stocks (e.g. NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, ORCL, PLTR).
- Use a JSON config file (`config/config.json`) to control tickers and date range.
- Download data with `yfinance`, clean it, and build simple features like daily returns.
- Use notebooks to explore the data and make basic plots.
